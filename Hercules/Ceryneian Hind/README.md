## Assignement
----
###### Write a script that takes a text file as a parameter with one login per line and returns the location of each person.
###### The script must use 42’s API to find where students are located in the zones.
###### If the API is not responding the script should retry until the API responds.
###### Externalize the API key so you don’t have it in plain text in your script file.

## Goals
----
###### This project aims to give us a basic understanding of REST APIs, how they work and potentially give us a brief understanding of how web APIs are made.
